## Assignment 2 - Digital Makeup Transfer

In this assignment, an approach of creating face makeup upon a face image with another image as the style example, has been implemented. This is similar to physical makeup as the color and skin details are modified while preserving the face structure. More precisely, the two images are first decomposed into three layers: face structure layer, skin detail layer, and color layer. Thereafter, information from each layer of one image is transferred to corresponding layer of the other image. The experimentation results at the end, demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach​ ​ in​ ​ faithfully​ ​ transferring​ ​ makeup.

This involves the implementation of `Guo, Dong, and Terence Sim. “Digital face makeup by example.” Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009. CVPR ​2009. IEEE ​Conference on. IEEE, ​2009.` [Link](./Paper.pdf)
