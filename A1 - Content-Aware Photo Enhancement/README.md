## Assignment 1 - Content-Aware Automatic Photo Enhancement

Automatic photo enhancement is one of the longstanding goals in image processing and computational photography. While a variety of methods have been proposed for manipulating tone and color, most automatic methods used in practice, operate on the entire image without attempting to take the content of the image into account.

The aim is to design a new framework for automatic photo enhancement that attempts to take local and global image semantics into account. The content-aware scheme should detect and enhance the appearance of human faces, blue skies with or without clouds, and underexposed salient regions.

This involves the implementation of `Kaufman, Liad, Dani Lischinski, and Michael Werman. "Content‚ÄêAware Automatic Photo Enhancement." Computer Graphics Forum. Vol. 31. No. 8. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2012.` [Link](./Paper.pdf)
