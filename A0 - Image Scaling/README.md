# Assignment 0 - Image Scaling

The aim is to perform the scaling operation to an image. The scaling up should be done using 
1. replication
2. interpolation

The scaling down should be done with the corresponding operations as would be used for scaling up. Consider a window (a rectangular area) of a given size for the display within which the zoomed-in or out area is shown when placed on the image.
